# Pokernova

Pokernova is a browser-based poker cardroom built with SvelteKit and Socket.IO. It implements __no limit Texas hold 'em__ rules.

I first started this project to try write my own poker hand evaluator, until it expanded to a practice project for Svelte to showcase winning hands and eventually into a cardroom web app.

## Setup

Run the following:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jlhechanova/poker.git
cd poker
npm install
```

## Development server

To start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
